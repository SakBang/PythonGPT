            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <p><b>It is very easy to use just add the bot in your discord server and tag the bot with "@". And then type what you wanna ask; it may take a while, but you will get your answer. You can ask anything from the bot, whether it is about Coding or Science stuff. It will answer you, but <b><i>the bot can type only 2000</i></b> words at one time, so keep that in mind and don't ask too much stuff at one time. And that's it.</b></p>
